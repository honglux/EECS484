----
INFO
----
This is the class project to use the MNIST and TensorFlow to implement error correction neural networks.
We have two networks
1. Auto-associative Memory networks, with the file "memoryEC.py"
2. Fully Connected networks, with the file "FullyConnectEC.py"

Notice
------
The data file path and directory will be needed to be specified in the ".py" file, please specify them manually;
Or, A very simple way is to put all the data files in the same directory with the ".py" file.

Other Files
-----------
"errorWrite.py": Function for generating error files. Will write to the file "temp" every time.
"mnist.py": Alex's work for reading and ploting MNIST data.
 "test_5_bit_flip": Test image data with 5 bit flipped for each image.
 "test_10_bit_flip": Test image data with 10 bit flipped for each image.
 "test_50_bit_flip": Test image data with 50 bit flipped for each image.
 "test_100_bit_flip": Test image data with 100 bit flipped for each image.
 "test_500_bit_flip": Test image data with 500 bit flipped for each image.
 "train_50_bit_flip": Training image data with 50 bit flipped for each image.
